# AI-Chatbot-with-NLP
This project is a simple yet functional AI Chatbot developed using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) concepts with the help of the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. It demonstrates how machines can simulate human-like conversations using rule-based pattern matching, reflection logic, and basic text preprocessing. The chatbot is capable of handling common user queries and is an excellent starting point for understanding how NLP can be used in building conversational agents.

# Project Objective
The main goal of this project is to build an AI-powered chatbot that can:
Engage in text-based conversations.
Recognize specific user inputs using regular expressions.
Respond contextually with pre-defined answers.
Exit the conversation gracefully when prompted.
This project is perfect for beginners in NLP, Python learners, or anyone interested in exploring the basics of chatbot development.

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x – Core programming language.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) – A powerful library for NLP operations and pattern-based conversations.
Regex (Regular Expressions) – To match user inputs with appropriate chatbot responses.

# Features
Responds to greetings like "hi", "hello", "hey".
Answers questions about itself and NLP.
Recognizes queries using pattern matching.
Uses reflections to make replies more natural (e.g., "I am" → "you are").
Gracefully exits when the user types "bye", "exit", or "quit".
Handles unrecognized inputs with fallback responses.
Fully commented code to help understand the flow and logic.
